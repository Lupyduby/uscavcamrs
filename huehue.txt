if i were you guys, create a separate repo for your documents and code

the point is that when you have a repository pure codes ra tanan
- NO MORE UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS TO UNNECESSARY FILES 
- you can directly save it to your xampp htdocs
- so if nag code and at the same time nag test ka sa xampp ,then you are just 1 click away when committing your changes
- no more copy paste, just make sure you make you have your own branch, so that the master file will be safe
- another thing is you could actually check out the branches anytime without affecting the master, for example naay 2 ka branch namely jesseth_branch and jacob_branch
then c jesseth nag work sa index while c jacob nag work sa register page,
if naay problem c jesseth sa index page , jacob then can actually see the progress of jesseth without affecting jacob_branch just by selecting the branch in the git then it automatically checks out the jesseth_branch and loads in your computer.
