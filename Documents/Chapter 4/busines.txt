The developed system’s core functionality is to be able to reserve the different hall in the university such as: Rigney Hall, Philip Van Englen, Robert Hoeppener Hall, Buttenbruch Hall, Gansewinkle Hall, Buchick Hall, through online access. And on the above business process diagram, the very first person to make a move is the client with regards to the process. The clients here are the faculty, employee and students of the University of San Carlos specifically those who are currently enrolled.
 A client can make a reservation that will be on a pending status which can cancel. The client will wait if the status of their reservation is successfully endorsed by their Dean for academic related reservation or Office of Student Affairs for Student Organizations and successfully approved by the Vice President-Academics or Vice President – Admin. Automatically the reservation status will be updated every time it is endorsed and approved has been made or if it will be declined the approver or the endorser can state its reason/s.
After the client’s status of reservation will be approved client will receive a notification that their reservation is now approved and ready to use. The audio visual staff will also be able to view/prints statistical data of the usage of the halls. The staff can also print the available software materials in the hall.
